R.M Drake

i am thinking about you
right now and i am sending 
you love, real love.

the kind that warms the skin 
and waits all night to be held
by the moon.

the kind that reminds you
of how beautiful you are under
the day and the night and
between what is left.

the kind that does not 
wake the next day alone.

this is me thinking about you 
tonight. this is me sending real 
love, all that there is to receive.

the only gift worth sending.
